title: Mitigating Overshoot
---

Please read the Deceleration page before looking at this one.

If your robot is overshooting in your auto, there are a couple of things you can try:
- Lower BrakingStrength: try lowering your BrakingStrength. Subtracting by intervals of 0.25 typically works well.
- Toggle Global Deceleration mode: if your PathChain has two or more paths, this will help a lot.
