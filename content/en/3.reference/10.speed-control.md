description: Controlling the speed that Pedro Pathing follows at
---

## Overview
Pedro Pathing has no built in movement speed or velocity limiter.
The best method currently is limiting motor powers.
There are 3 main ways you can limit the motor power that Pedro Pathing can use.

## Methods

### Global

This method is recommended if you never want Pedro Pathing to exceed a certain motor power.
The global default max power is stored in the `Constants` class,
specifically, the `driveConstants` variable.

::callout{type="info" title="Note"}
This is only guaranteed to work on mecanum drivetrains using the `MecanumConstants`
::

Simply change the value in `.maxPower(1)` (0 to 1).

### Per Path

This method is recommended if you want to slow down a particular path.
When following a path, you can use `follower.followPath(pathChain, maxPower, holdEnd)`.

::callout{type="warning" title="Note"}
When using the `maxPower` parameter, you must also include the `holdEnd` parameter.
The default for this value is `true`.
::

`maxPower` is a number from 0 to 1.

### Multiple Paths

`follower.setMaxPower(maxPower)` will set the speed of the follower until you change it again.
`maxPower` is a number from 0 to 1.
