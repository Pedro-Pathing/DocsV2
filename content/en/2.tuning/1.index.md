Tuning Pedro Pathing has five steps:

1. **[Setup](/en/tuning/setup)** - In this step, you set constants such as your robot's mass and motor names.
2. **[Localization](/en/tuning/localization)** - This allows for your robot to know its location on the field.
3. **[Automatic Tuners](/en/tuning/automatic)** - These tuners consist of running four OpModes that determine constants specific to your robot.
4. **[PID Tuners](/en/tuning/pids)** - This step is where you tune 3-6 PID controllers, translational, heading, and drive.
5. **[Centripetal Force Tuner](/en/tuning/pids/centripetal)** - This step consists of tuning a constant that accounts for centripetal force.
